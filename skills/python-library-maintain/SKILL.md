description: "Maintain Asset Transport — bump version, cut a release, refresh AGENTS.md, sync optional extras, run copier update. Use whenever the user wants to maintain or update this library — even if they don't say 'library' explicitly. Triggers on phrases like 'bump version', 'tag a release', 'refresh AGENTS', 'pull template improvements', 'add an extra', 'sync the template'."

# python-library-maintain — Asset Transport

In-satellite maintainer skill for the **stromy-asset-transport** library. This skill is shipped by the `python-library-template` Copier template — the same content lives in every Python-library satellite and in `stromy-org/.claude/skills/python-library-maintain/` (org mirror, propagated by `scripts/sync-maintainer-skills.sh`).

## When to use

- Bumping the library version + cutting a release tag.
- Refreshing AGENTS.md / re-rendering CLAUDE.md after edits.
- Adding or removing an optional-dependency extra.
- Pulling template improvements via `copier update --skip-answered`.

## When NOT to use

- Creating a new library from scratch → org-level `/repo-scaffold python-library`.
- General Python coding questions → use repo-specific or global skills.

## Workflows

### Bump version + release

1. Edit `[project].version` in `pyproject.toml` on `main`.
2. Relock in the same commit: `uv lock`. The version lives in `uv.lock` too, and
   the release refuses a lockfile that disagrees with `pyproject.toml`.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` if present.
4. Commit via `/conventional-commit`; land it on `main` the normal way.
5. Dispatch the release: `gh workflow run release.yml` (or Actions -> Release ->
   Run workflow). **Never type a tag.** The tag is an OUTPUT of that workflow,
   computed from `[project].version` — it is created only after the
   default-branch check, the main-ancestry check, lint, types, tests, the
   lockfile check and the build have all passed. A tag that disagreed with
   `pyproject.toml` is now unrepresentable rather than merely detected, and
   dispatching without having bumped the version is refused before anything is
   built. Use `-f dry_run=true` to run every gate and stop short of tagging.

**Consumer pins are not your job.** stromy-org's `internal-lib-pins.yml`
reconciles every consumer daily: it derives the graph from each repo's own
`[tool.uv.sources]` and opens the bump PRs, and it resolves `releases/latest`
rather than `tags` — so a tag that never became a release can never become
anyone's pin. Releasing is the whole task.

### Refresh AGENTS / re-render

1. Edit `AGENTS.md`.
2. Run `python3 scripts/render-agent-md.py`.
3. Commit AGENTS.md + the regenerated `CLAUDE.md` + `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in the **same logical unit**.

### Add or remove an optional extra

1. Edit `[project.optional-dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml`.
2. If adding code that uses the extra, guard imports with `try/except ImportError` and raise `DependencyError(extra="<name>", package="<pkg>")` so consumers get a clear install hint.
3. Add a `requires_<extra>` pytest marker in `pyproject.toml` `[tool.pytest.ini_options].markers` and mark relevant tests.
4. Run `uv sync --extra <name> && uv run pytest -m requires_<extra>`.

### Pull template improvements

1. From the lib root: `uvx copier update --trust --skip-answered`.
2. Review the diff carefully — answers stay; template improvements (CI workflow updates, AGENTS.md.jinja edits, ruff/pyright defaults) propagate.
3. Resolve conflicts by hand; do NOT regress public API.
4. Run the full quality stack before committing: `uv sync && uv run pytest && uv run ruff check src/ tests/ && uv run pyright src/stromy_asset_transport/`.

## Critical rules

- Every git commit goes through `/conventional-commit` (inherited skill).
- AGENTS.md is self-contained — no `@file` imports, no `.claude/rules/` references.
- Generated outputs (`CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) are committed but never hand-edited.
- Do not commit `.env` files. `.env.example` only.
- Public API (symbols in `__init__.py.__all__`) is a contract — drift requires a SemVer-major bump and consumer-side updates.
- Never weaken `[tool.pyright].typeCheckingMode = "strict"` to make errors go away; fix the types or add a per-symbol `# pyright: ignore[...]` with a justification.
